Softmax Regression 

- It is a generalization of classification for n classes 
if we take n = 2 then it boiled downs to logistic regression 

- Softmax regression function convert z Matrix score to  probabilities against each class 
and assigns a class with the highest probability to the data point 

- Softmax is used to define multiple boundries for data having multiple classes 

- It also computer coeffircients against all classes 


challenges Faced :

- Implementing gradient descend 
- Implementing Cross Entropy 
- Python syntax ( last semester worked with R )
